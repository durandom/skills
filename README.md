## 🗂️ Skills

### 🗺️ Code Mapping

> *"Where is this thing? What does this do?"* — Every developer, ever

Hierarchical documentation with **4 zoom levels**:

| Level | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 📋 **L0** | System overview | Architecture, entry points |
| 🏘️ **L1** | Domain modules | `auth/`, `api/`, `core/` |
| 📦 **L2** | Individual modules | Classes, key functions |
| 🔍 **L3** | Source code | The actual code |

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# 🔧 Generate code maps from source
uv run python skills/code-mapping/scripts/code_map.py generate src/ docs/map/

# ✅ Validate existing maps
uv run python skills/code-mapping/scripts/code_map.py validate docs/map/
```

### ✅ GTD (Getting Things Done)

> 🧘 *"Mind like water"* — David Allen

A CLI-based task management system following the **GTD methodology**:

```
📥 Capture → 🔍 Clarify → 🗂️ Organize → 🔄 Reflect → ▶️ Engage
```

**Features:**

- 🏷️ **12 Fixed Labels** — context, energy, status, horizon
- 🎯 **6 Horizons of Focus** — from actions to life purpose
- 📆 **Review Workflows** — daily, weekly, quarterly, yearly
- 🐙 **GitHub Backend** — issues as your task store

**Quick Start:**

```bash
# 📥 Capture a new task
./skills/gtd/scripts/gtd capture "Review PR #42"

# 📋 List tasks by context
./skills/gtd/scripts/gtd list --context focus --energy high

# 🌅 Start your daily review
./skills/gtd/scripts/gtd daily
```

### 📂 PARA

> 🗂️ *Organize by actionability, not topic*

The PARA method for organizing notes into four categories based on **when you'll need them**:

| Category | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| 📁 **Projects** | Active goals with deadlines |
| 🔄 **Areas** | Ongoing responsibilities |
| 📚 **Resources** | Topics of interest |
| 🗄️ **Archive** | Inactive items |

Standalone knowledge organization with CLI for project management, folder structure, and archiving.

### 🐙 GitHub

> 🔧 *Unified interface for GitHub operations*

GitHub CLI operations using `gh`:

- 📋 **Issue Triage** — prioritize and label issues
- 🔍 **PR Review** — review workflows and checklists
- 🚀 **CI Monitoring** — check pipeline status
- 🤖 **Copilot Iteration** — track Copilot-assisted workflows

### 🕷️ crawl4ai

> 🌐 *Extract web content as clean markdown*

Web crawling and data extraction using the `crwl` CLI. Handles static sites, JavaScript-rendered SPAs, and structured data extraction.

### 📝 Meeting Notes

> 🎙️ *Sync and manage meeting transcripts*

Syncs Google Calendar meetings with Gemini transcripts, organizing them into a meetings directory with tag-based categorization.

/commit staged   # 📋 Only commit staged changes
/commit amend    # ✏️ Fix the last commit
/commit split    # 🔀 Interactive multi-commit
/commit dry-run  # 👀 Preview without committing
```

### `/catchup` 🔄

Session restart orientation:

```bash
/catchup         # 📊 Review recent changes
/catchup HEAD~3  # 🕐 Review specific commit
```

### `/research` 🔬

Parallel research with synthesized output:

```bash
/research "topic"            # 📊 Standard research
/research "topic" --quick    # ⚡ Quick overview
/research "topic" --thorough # 🔍 Deep dive
```
