# Complementary Skills: GTD

## What is GTD?

GTD (Getting Things Done) is David Allen's methodology for personal productivity. It provides a trusted workflow for capturing, clarifying, organizing, and reviewing commitments — turning "stuff" into actionable next steps.

## How GTD Complements PARA

PARA is a **filing cabinet** — it organizes your notes and documents. GTD is a **workflow engine** — it tracks what to do next. Together they cover both organization and execution, but neither requires the other.

| System | Handles | Typical Storage |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| PARA | Notes, documentation, reference files | Filesystem folders |
| GTD | Task tracking, next actions, reviews | GitHub issues / Taskwarrior |

## Optional Sync Points

If you use both skills, you may find these natural alignment points useful:

- **Projects:** A PARA project folder often has a matching GTD project (milestone) tracking its tasks and next actions
- **Areas:** PARA's `2_Areas/` maps to GTD's H2 "Areas of Focus" — both represent ongoing responsibilities
- **Archive:** Archiving a PARA folder is a natural time to close the corresponding GTD project milestone

These are conventions, not enforced rules. Each skill works independently.
