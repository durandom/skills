## Organization Mistakes

<mistake name="Organizing by Topic Instead of Actionability">
**Symptom:** Can't find things when needed, everything feels disconnected, folders don't match workflow.

**Why it happens:**

- Traditional folder thinking
- "JavaScript" folder for all JS content
- Ignoring the "when will I need this?" question

**Fix:**

- Ask "when will I use this?" not "what is this about?"
- Same topic can be in different PARA categories
- Project notes in Projects, even if topic exists in Resources
</mistake>

<mistake name="Too Many Projects">
**Symptom:** Overwhelm, nothing gets finished, context switching fatigue.

**Why it happens:**

- Everything feels urgent
- Not saying no
- Areas treated as Projects

**Fix:**

- Honest: can you work on more than 5-7 projects?
- Move inactive projects to Archive or Someday/Maybe
- Distinguish Areas (maintain) from Projects (complete)
- Review project list weekly
</mistake>

<mistake name="Empty Area Maintenance">
**Symptom:** Areas become neglected, standards slip, reactive instead of proactive.

**Why it happens:**

- No scheduled review
- Areas don't have "next actions"
- Focus on projects ignores responsibilities

**Fix:**

- Monthly area review
- Areas generate projects
- Areas need attention, not just projects
</mistake>

<mistake name="Resources Become a Dumping Ground">
**Symptom:** Resources folder grows endlessly, nothing is ever found again, collector's fallacy.

**Why it happens:**

- Saving feels productive
- Not documenting properly when saving
- "I might need this someday"

**Fix:**

- Write good documentation when you save
- Delete resources not accessed in 6 months
- Organize by topic with clear naming
- Quality over quantity
</mistake>

<mistake name="Never Archiving">
**Symptom:** Active folders cluttered with completed work, hard to focus, system slows down.

**Why it happens:**

- Fear of losing information
- No completion ritual
- "What if I need it?"

**Fix:**

- Archive is searchable, not deleted
- Archive completed projects promptly
- Archive quarterly at minimum
- Archived content is still accessible
</mistake>
