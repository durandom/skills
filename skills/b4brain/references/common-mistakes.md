## Capture Layer Mistakes

<mistake name="Not Capturing">
**Symptom:** Ideas forgotten, commitments missed, anxiety about what you might be forgetting.

**Why it happens:**

- Capture feels like interruption
- "I'll remember this"
- No quick capture method available

**Fix:**

- Use `/capture` immediately (2 seconds)
- Keep SCRATCH.md open in a tab
- Capture first, organize never (during work)
- Trust the system to hold it
</mistake>

<mistake name="Over-Capturing">
**Symptom:** Inbox overflows, processing takes hours, system feels burdensome.

**Why it happens:**

- Treating capture as organization
- Adding detail during capture
- Saving everything "just in case"

**Fix:**

- Capture is just a pointer ("meeting with Sarah")
- Minimal viable capture
- Delete more during processing
- Not everything needs saving
</mistake>

<mistake name="Capture Without Processing">
**Symptom:** Inbox becomes a graveyard, old items never processed, defeat.

**Why it happens:**

- Processing is hard/unclear
- No regular review habit
- System not trusted

**Fix:**

- Daily: process 1-3 items
- Weekly: process to zero
- `/inbox` forces the workflow
- Small consistent processing beats big batches
</mistake>

## PARA Layer Mistakes

<mistake name="Organizing by Topic Instead of Actionability">
**Symptom:** Can't find things when needed, everything feels disconnected, folders don't match workflow.

**Why it happens:**

- Traditional folder thinking
- "JavaScript" folder for all JS content
- Ignoring the "when will I need this?" question

**Fix:**

- Ask "when will I use this?" not "what is this about?"
- Same topic can be in different PARA categories
- Project notes in Projects, even if topic exists in Resources
</mistake>

<mistake name="Too Many Projects">
**Symptom:** Overwhelm, nothing gets finished, context switching fatigue.

**Why it happens:**

- Everything feels urgent
- Not saying no
- Areas treated as Projects

**Fix:**

- Honest: can you work on more than 5-7 projects?
- Move inactive projects to Archive or Someday/Maybe
- Distinguish Areas (maintain) from Projects (complete)
- Review project list weekly
</mistake>

<mistake name="Empty Area Maintenance">
**Symptom:** Areas become neglected, standards slip, reactive instead of proactive.

**Why it happens:**

- No scheduled review
- Areas don't have "next actions"
- Focus on projects ignores responsibilities

**Fix:**

- Monthly area review
- Areas generate projects
- Track area health in `/review monthly`
- Areas need attention, not just projects
</mistake>

<mistake name="Resources Become a Dumping Ground">
**Symptom:** Resources folder grows endlessly, nothing is ever found again, collector's fallacy.

**Why it happens:**

- Saving feels productive
- Not documenting properly when saving
- "I might need this someday"

**Fix:**

- Write good documentation when you save
- Delete resources not accessed in 6 months
- Organize by topic with clear naming
- Quality over quantity
</mistake>

<mistake name="Never Archiving">
**Symptom:** Active folders cluttered with completed work, hard to focus, system slows down.

**Why it happens:**

- Fear of losing information
- No completion ritual
- "What if I need it?"

**Fix:**

- Archive is searchable, not deleted
- Use `/project complete` for clean endings
- Archive quarterly at minimum
- Archived content is still accessible
</mistake>

</para_mistakes>

<gtd_mistakes>

## GTD Layer Mistakes

<mistake name="Vague Next Actions">
**Symptom:** Tasks sit undone, procrastination, unclear what to actually do.

**Why it happens:**

- Not clarifying during processing
- Outcome-level thinking only
- "I know what I mean"

**Fix:**

- Next action must be physical and visible
- "Work on presentation" → "Open slides and write intro paragraph"
- Test: can you visualize yourself doing it?
- If unclear, clarify before adding
</mistake>

<mistake name="Too Many Priorities">
**Symptom:** Everything is 🔥, priorities meaningless, no focus.

**Why it happens:**

- Urgency addiction
- Fear of missing something
- No real prioritization process

**Fix:**

- 🔥 High should be rare (1-3 at a time)
- Most things are ⚠️ Medium
- Weekly review resets priorities
- If everything is urgent, nothing is
</mistake>

<mistake name="Ignoring Context Tags">
**Symptom:** Long task lists, decision fatigue, wrong tasks for the situation.

**Why it happens:**

- Not filtering by context
- Viewing full list always
- Not thinking about where/how

**Fix:**

- Filter by @context when working
- Only see tasks you can actually do now
- Add context during `/inbox` processing
- Context reduces decision fatigue
</mistake>

<mistake name="Skipping Reviews">
**Symptom:** System drift, lost trust, incomplete information, anxiety returns.

**Why it happens:**

- Reviews feel unproductive
- "I'll catch up later"
- No scheduled time

**Fix:**

- Daily review: 5 minutes (just priorities)
- Weekly review: 15 minutes (full system)
- Schedule reviews like meetings
- Reviews ARE the system
</mistake>

<mistake name="Waiting For Without Tracking">
**Symptom:** Delegated items forgotten, follow-ups missed, others' delays become your problem.

**Why it happens:**

- "They'll remember"
- No @waiting context
- Delegation without tracking

**Fix:**

- Always add to @waiting when delegating
- Include who, what, when expected
- Review @waiting in weekly review
- Follow up proactively
</mistake>

</gtd_mistakes>

<system_mistakes>

## System-Level Mistakes

<mistake name="System as End, Not Means">
**Symptom:** More time organizing than working, constant system tweaking, productivity theater.

**Why it happens:**

- Organizing feels productive
- Procrastination disguised
- Perfectionism

**Fix:**

- System serves work, not vice versa
- "Is this helping me do work?"
- Simple > complex
- Good enough is good enough
</mistake>

<mistake name="All-or-Nothing Thinking">
**Symptom:** System abandoned after lapses, guilt about not following perfectly, restart cycles.

**Why it happens:**

- Perfectionism
- Seeing lapse as failure
- Not accepting imperfection

**Fix:**

- Lapses are normal
- Just start again from where you are
- Imperfect system > no system
- Weekly review catches up
</mistake>

<mistake name="Wrong Tool for the Task">
**Symptom:** Using complex tools for simple things, overthinking what should be easy.

**Why it happens:**

- Not understanding what each command does
- Over-engineering simple tasks
- Not choosing consciously

**Fix:**

- Quick capture → `/capture`
- Processing items → `/inbox`
- Filing things → PARA folders
- Finding things → Obsidian search
- Match tool to need, keep it simple
</mistake>

<recovery_strategies>

## Recovery Strategies

**When inbox is overwhelming:**

1. Don't try to process everything
2. Pick the 5 most important items
3. Process those through `/inbox`
4. Archive or delete everything else
5. Commit to regular processing going forward

**When projects feel stuck:**

1. `/review weekly` to see full picture
2. Ensure each project has ONE next action
3. Move stalled projects to Someday/Maybe
4. Focus on fewer projects

**When you've lost trust in the system:**

1. Start fresh with capture only
2. Process new items for one week
3. Don't worry about backlog yet
4. Rebuild trust through consistency
5. Then gradually tackle old items

**When documentation is poor:**

1. Don't try to backfill everything
2. Start fresh - document new things well
3. Update old notes when you use them
4. Better documentation compounds over time
