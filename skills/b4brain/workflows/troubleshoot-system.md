## Step 1: Identify the Symptom

Common symptoms users report:

| Symptom | Likely Problem Area |
|---------|---------------------|
| "Inbox is overwhelming" | Capture or processing issue |
| "Can't find things" | PARA organization issue |
| "Nothing gets done" | GTD task/priority issue |
| "System feels pointless" | Integration or trust issue |
| "Too much overhead" | Over-engineering issue |
| "Lost track of projects" | Review habit issue |
| "Notes are useless" | Zettelkasten execution issue |

Ask the user to describe:

- What specifically feels wrong?
- When did it start feeling this way?
- What were you doing (or not doing)?

## Step 2: Diagnose Root Cause

Use this diagnostic tree:

```
Symptom: Overwhelmed/Anxious
├── Inbox overflowing?
│   ├── YES → Not processing regularly
│   │         Fix: Daily 10-min /inbox sessions
│   └── NO → Too many commitments captured?
│            Fix: Say no more, review projects
│
├── Too many projects?
│   ├── YES → Not distinguishing Areas from Projects
│   │         Fix: Review list, archive inactive
│   └── NO → Priorities unclear?
│            Fix: Weekly review, reset priorities
│
└── Captured but not trusted?
    └── Process items to build trust

Symptom: Can't Find Things
├── Filed in wrong PARA category?
│   └── Fix: Re-categorize by actionability
├── No indexes/organization?
│   └── Fix: Run /index, update _INDEX.md
└── Not using search?
    └── Fix: Use /search, Obsidian search

Symptom: Tasks Not Getting Done
├── Tasks too vague?
│   └── Fix: Clarify to physical next actions
├── Wrong context/priority?
│   └── Fix: Reassign contexts and priorities
├── Too many tasks?
│   └── Fix: Review, delete, defer, focus
└── Not filtering by context?
    └── Fix: Work from filtered list

Symptom: System Feels Like Burden
├── Too much organizing?
│   └── Fix: Simplify, just-in-time structure
├── Not seeing value?
│   └── Fix: Use system for real work, not perfectly
└── Over-engineered?
    └── Fix: Reduce to essentials
```

## Step 3: Confirm Diagnosis

Before prescribing a fix, confirm:

- "It sounds like [diagnosis]. Does that match your experience?"
- Ask for specific examples if unclear
- Consider multiple contributing factors

## Step 4: Provide Fix

For each problem, provide:

1. **Why this happened** - Understanding prevents recurrence
2. **Immediate action** - What to do right now
3. **Ongoing habit** - What to do regularly

### Common Fixes

**Inbox Overflow:**

```
Immediate: Don't try to process everything
1. Pick 5 most important items
2. Process those with /inbox
3. Archive or delete the rest

Ongoing: Daily 10-minute processing
Schedule it like a meeting
```

**Too Many Projects:**

```
Immediate: Review project list
1. /project status to see all
2. Archive completed/stalled projects
3. Move "someday" projects to Someday/Maybe
4. Keep only 5-7 active projects

Ongoing: Weekly project review
Ask "Can I actually work on this this week?"
```

**Tasks Not Moving:**

```
Immediate: Clarify stuck tasks
1. Review _GTD_TASKS.md
2. For each stuck task, ask "What's the actual next physical action?"
3. Rewrite vague tasks
4. Delete tasks that don't matter

Ongoing: Enforce "next action" thinking during /inbox
```

**System Distrust:**

```
Immediate: Start fresh
1. Commit to capture EVERYTHING for one week
2. Process daily (even if small)
3. Do one weekly review

Ongoing: Consistency builds trust
The system works when you work the system
```

**Zettelkasten Confusion:**

```
Immediate: Pause Zettelkasten
1. Focus on GTD + PARA only
2. Let Zettelkasten wait
3. Return when you have content worth synthesizing

Ongoing: Zettelkasten is optional
It's for deep knowledge work, not everything
```

## Step 5: Suggest Prevention

After fixing the immediate issue, recommend:

- Review habits to maintain (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Simplified workflows if over-engineered
- Permission to let things be imperfect

## Step 6: Check Recovery

End with:

- "Try this and let me know how it goes"
- Offer to help with follow-up issues
- Remind that lapses are normal and recoverable

## Quick Fix Reference

| Problem | Quick Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Inbox overflowing | Archive everything, start fresh, commit to daily processing |
| Can't find things | Use /search, update indexes with /index |
| Tasks ignored | Clarify next actions, reduce list, filter by context |
| Too many projects | Archive to 5-7 active, rest to someday/maybe |
| Skipped reviews | Schedule daily 5-min, weekly 15-min reviews |
| Notes useless | Pause Zettelkasten, focus on GTD+PARA |
| System feels heavy | Simplify, remove complexity, good enough is enough |
| Lost trust | Start fresh, be consistent for 2 weeks |

- "Just start from where you are"
- "The system serves you, not vice versa"
- "Weekly review catches everything"
- "Capture is cheap, organize is optional"
- "Good enough is good enough"
</recovery_mantras>
