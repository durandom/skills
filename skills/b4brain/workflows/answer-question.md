# Workflow: Answer Methodology Question

<objective>
Explain concepts from PARA, GTD, or Zettelkasten methodologies as they apply to the b4brain system. Provide clear, practical answers that help users understand and apply the methodology.
</objective>

<required_reading>
**Read reference files based on the question topic:**

| Topic | Reference to Read |
| --- | --- |
| PARA, categorization, folders | references/para-method.md |
| GTD, tasks, inbox, clarify, review | references/gtd-workflow.md |
| Zettelkasten, atomic notes, connections | references/zettelkasten-principles.md |
| Integration, combined workflow | references/unified-workflow.md |
| Folder structure, naming | references/b4brain-structure.md |
| "When to use...", comparisons | references/decision-trees.md |

<process>
## Step 1: Identify the Question Type

Determine what kind of question is being asked:

**Conceptual:** "What is..." "Why does..." "How does..."

- Explain the underlying principle
- Connect to the specific methodology
- Show how it works in b4brain

**Comparative:** "What's the difference..." "When should I use..."

- Use decision trees from references
- Compare options directly
- Give clear recommendations

**Practical:** "How do I..." "What command..."

- Point to specific commands
- Walk through the workflow
- Give concrete examples

## Step 2: Read Relevant Reference

Load the appropriate reference file(s) based on the topic.

If the question spans multiple methodologies, prioritize:

1. The most directly relevant reference
2. `unified-workflow.md` for integration questions
3. `decision-trees.md` for "when to use" questions

## Step 3: Formulate the Answer

Structure the response:

1. **Direct answer first** - Answer the actual question immediately
2. **Explanation** - Why it works this way
3. **Practical application** - How to apply in b4brain
4. **Related concepts** - What else might be helpful

**Keep answers focused:**

- Don't explain the entire methodology
- Answer what was asked
- Offer to elaborate if needed

## Step 4: Include Actionable Guidance

Where applicable, include:

- Specific commands to use
- Example scenarios
- Decision criteria
- Links to related concepts

## Step 5: Offer Follow-up

End with:

- Related questions they might have
- Commands they can try
- Deeper topics to explore
</process>

## Answer Templates

**For "What is X?" questions:**

```
[X] is [one-sentence definition].

In b4brain, this means:
- [How it manifests in the system]
- [Why it matters for the workflow]

To use [X]:
[Practical guidance or command]
```

**For "What's the difference between X and Y?" questions:**

```
The key difference:
- **[X]:** [Core characteristic]
- **[Y]:** [Core characteristic]

Use [X] when: [scenario]
Use [Y] when: [scenario]

In b4brain:
- [X] → [where/how]
- [Y] → [where/how]
```

**For "How do I...?" questions:**

```
To [do the thing]:

1. [First step]
2. [Second step]
3. [Third step]

Use: `[command]`

Example:
[Concrete example of the workflow]
```

**For "Why...?" questions:**

```
[Direct answer to why]

The reasoning:
- [Principle 1]
- [Principle 2]

This prevents:
- [Problem it solves]

In practice, this means:
[Practical implication]
```

## Common Questions Reference

**"What's the difference between a Project and an Area?"**
→ Read: para-method.md (four_pillars section)
→ Key: Projects have deadlines and can be completed. Areas are ongoing.

**"When should I use /inbox vs /capture?"**
→ Read: gtd-workflow.md
→ Key: /capture just saves. /inbox clarifies and organizes.

**"How do I know what context to use?"**
→ Read: decision-trees.md (context_assignment)
→ Key: Where/how will the task be done?

**"What makes a good atomic note?"**
→ Read: zettelkasten-principles.md (fundamental_principles)
→ Key: One idea, your own words, connected to other notes.

**"How do the three systems work together?"**
→ Read: unified-workflow.md
→ Key: GTD captures/clarifies, PARA organizes, Zettelkasten synthesizes.

**"When should I archive something?"**
→ Read: para-method.md (four_pillars - Archives section)
→ Key: When it's no longer active but worth keeping.
