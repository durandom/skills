# Complementary Skills: PARA

## What is PARA?

PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive) is a method for organizing notes and files by **actionability** rather than topic. It provides a filing system for your knowledge — documents, notes, reference material, and project artifacts.

## How PARA Complements GTD

GTD is a **workflow engine** — it tracks what to do and when. PARA is a **filing cabinet** — it stores the materials you work with. Together they cover both execution and organization, but neither requires the other.

| System | Handles | Typical Storage |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| GTD | Task tracking, next actions, reviews | GitHub issues / Taskwarrior |
| PARA | Notes, documentation, reference files | Filesystem folders |

## Optional Sync Points

If you use both skills, you may find these natural alignment points useful:

- **Projects:** A GTD project (milestone) often has a matching PARA project folder containing its working documents
- **Areas:** GTD's H2 "Areas of Focus" maps to PARA's `2_Areas/` — both represent ongoing responsibilities
- **Archive:** Completing a GTD project is a natural time to archive the corresponding PARA folder

These are conventions, not enforced rules. Each skill works independently.
