## Capture Layer Mistakes

<mistake name="Not Capturing">
**Symptom:** Ideas forgotten, commitments missed, anxiety about what you might be forgetting.

**Why it happens:**

- Capture feels like interruption
- "I'll remember this"
- No quick capture method available

**Fix:**

- Capture immediately (2 seconds)
- Keep inbox always accessible
- Capture first, organize never (during work)
- Trust the system to hold it
</mistake>

<mistake name="Over-Capturing">
**Symptom:** Inbox overflows, processing takes hours, system feels burdensome.

**Why it happens:**

- Treating capture as organization
- Adding detail during capture
- Saving everything "just in case"

**Fix:**

- Capture is just a pointer ("meeting with Sarah")
- Minimal viable capture
- Delete more during processing
- Not everything needs saving
</mistake>

<mistake name="Capture Without Processing">
**Symptom:** Inbox becomes a graveyard, old items never processed, defeat.

**Why it happens:**

- Processing is hard/unclear
- No regular review habit
- System not trusted

**Fix:**

- Daily: process 1-3 items
- Weekly: process to zero
- Small consistent processing beats big batches
</mistake>

## GTD Workflow Mistakes

<mistake name="Vague Next Actions">
**Symptom:** Tasks sit undone, procrastination, unclear what to actually do.

**Why it happens:**

- Not clarifying during processing
- Outcome-level thinking only
- "I know what I mean"

**Fix:**

- Next action must be physical and visible
- "Work on presentation" → "Open slides and write intro paragraph"
- Test: can you visualize yourself doing it?
- If unclear, clarify before adding
</mistake>

<mistake name="Too Many Priorities">
**Symptom:** Everything is high priority, priorities meaningless, no focus.

**Why it happens:**

- Urgency addiction
- Fear of missing something
- No real prioritization process

**Fix:**

- High energy tasks should be rare (1-3 at a time)
- Most things are medium/low energy
- Weekly review resets priorities
- If everything is urgent, nothing is
</mistake>

<mistake name="Ignoring Context Tags">
**Symptom:** Long task lists, decision fatigue, wrong tasks for the situation.

**Why it happens:**

- Not filtering by context
- Viewing full list always
- Not thinking about where/how

**Fix:**

- Filter by context when working
- Only see tasks you can actually do now
- Add context during processing
- Context reduces decision fatigue
</mistake>

<mistake name="Skipping Reviews">
**Symptom:** System drift, lost trust, incomplete information, anxiety returns.

**Why it happens:**

- Reviews feel unproductive
- "I'll catch up later"
- No scheduled time

**Fix:**

- Daily review: 5 minutes (just priorities)
- Weekly review: 15 minutes (full system)
- Schedule reviews like meetings
- Reviews ARE the system
</mistake>

<mistake name="Waiting For Without Tracking">
**Symptom:** Delegated items forgotten, follow-ups missed, others' delays become your problem.

**Why it happens:**

- "They'll remember"
- No waiting context
- Delegation without tracking

**Fix:**

- Always track when delegating
- Include who, what, when expected
- Review waiting items in weekly review
- Follow up proactively
</mistake>
