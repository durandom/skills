# GTD Skill TODO

## Work Items

### Extract taxonomy into configuration

**Goal:** Make label taxonomy configurable per-repo rather than hardcoded.

**Status:** Future work - requires configuration file support

---

### ~~Remove area and type labels~~ ✅

**Goal:** Remove project-specific labels to make the GTD skill reusable.

**Changes:**

- [x] Remove `area/*` labels (8 labels) - organization-specific
- [x] Remove `type/*` labels (4 labels) - "achievement" and "blocked" are non-standard GTD

**Keep (4 dimensions):**

- `context/*` - focus, meetings, async, offsite
- `energy/*` - high, low
- `horizon/*` - now, soon, later, waiting
- `priority/*` - urgent, high, normal, low
