# Phase 06 Plan 03: Explore Workflow Summary

**Explore workflow with 5-step process for codebase navigation, plus working test map for fvtt2obsidian**

## Accomplishments

- Created explore.md workflow with 5 numbered steps for systematic map navigation
- Built working test map for fvtt2obsidian repo (MAP.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, domains/conversion.md)
- Manually tested the workflow successfully using the test map
- Updated SKILL.md to mark explore.md as Done

## Files Created/Modified

- `.claude/skills/code-map/workflows/explore.md` - 5-step explore workflow with success criteria
- `docs/map/MAP.md` - Entry point with domains index and code statistics
- `docs/map/ARCHITECTURE.md` - L0 architecture (98 lines) with pipeline diagram and entry points
- `docs/map/domains/conversion.md` - L1 domain doc (84 lines) with code links
- `.claude/skills/code-map/SKILL.md` - Updated workflow status
- `.planning/phases/06-code-map-skill/ROADMAP.md` - Updated plan 03 status

## Decisions Made

- Used ASCII box diagrams instead of mermaid for portability
- Referenced actual line numbers from source code (cli.py, converter.py, linker.py)
- Created only one domain (conversion) for minimal viable test

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

- Explore workflow complete and tested
- Test map demonstrates format works in practice
- Ready for Plan 04 (create workflow + validation script)
