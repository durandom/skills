# Phase 06 Plan 02: Templates Summary

**Copy-and-fill templates for MAP.md (entry point), L0 (architecture), and L1 (domains) with FILL markers and size warnings**

## Accomplishments

- Created MAP.md template (81 lines) with Quick Start, Format Overview, Domains Index, and Navigation diagram
- Created L0-architecture.md template (108 lines) with anchors, tech stack table, diagram placeholder, domain map, entry points
- Created L1-domain.md template (93 lines) with anchors, purpose, entry points, dependencies, key files

## Files Created/Modified

- `.claude/skills/code-map/templates/MAP.md` - Entry point template with agent bootstrap instructions
- `.claude/skills/code-map/templates/L0-architecture.md` - System-wide architecture template
- `.claude/skills/code-map/templates/L1-domain.md` - Domain documentation template

## Decisions Made

- Kept MAP.md under 100 lines by using brief format overview linking to full spec
- Used HTML comments for FILL instructions (hidden in rendered markdown)
- Included size warnings as both HTML comments at top and plain text in closing instructions

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None

## Next Phase Readiness

- All templates ready for use by explore and create workflows
- Format matches format-spec.md syntax (anchors, code links, cross-refs)
- Ready for Plan 03 (explore workflow)
