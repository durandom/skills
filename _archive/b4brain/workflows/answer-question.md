# Workflow: Answer Integration Question

<objective>
Explain how GTD and PARA work together in the b4brain system. For methodology-specific questions, direct users to the standalone skills.
</objective>

<required_reading>
**Read reference files based on the question topic:**

| Topic | Reference to Read |
|-------|-------------------|
| Integration, combined workflow | references/unified-workflow.md |
| Folder structure, naming | references/b4brain-structure.md |
| System-level problems | references/common-mistakes.md |

**For methodology-specific questions, direct to standalone skills:**

| Topic | Redirect To |
|-------|-------------|
| PARA categorization, folders | `para` skill |
| GTD tasks, inbox, clarify, review | `gtd` skill |

</required_reading>

<process>

## Step 1: Determine If This Is an Integration Question

This skill handles questions about:

- How GTD and PARA work **together**
- When to use which system
- Cross-system workflows (e.g., syncing projects)
- System-level troubleshooting

**Redirect** methodology-specific questions:

- "How does PARA categorization work?" → Use the `para` skill
- "How do I clarify tasks in GTD?" → Use the `gtd` skill

## Step 2: For Integration Questions

Read the relevant reference file(s) and formulate an answer:

1. **Direct answer first** - Answer the actual question immediately
2. **Explanation** - Why it works this way
3. **Practical application** - How to apply in b4brain
4. **Which skill to use** - Point to GTD or PARA skill for execution

## Step 3: Common Integration Questions

**"How do PARA and GTD work together?"**
→ Read: unified-workflow.md
→ Key: GTD handles capture and tasks, PARA handles organization

**"When should I use GTD vs PARA?"**
→ GTD: For actionable items, tasks, reviews
→ PARA: For organizing files and notes by actionability

**"How do I sync projects between systems?"**
→ Use the b4brain sync workflow (sync-para-gtd.md)

**"What's the relationship between GTD Horizons and PARA?"**
→ Key: GTD H2 (Areas of Focus) maps to PARA Areas folder
