## System-Level Mistakes

<mistake name="System as End, Not Means">
**Symptom:** More time organizing than working, constant system tweaking, productivity theater.

**Why it happens:**

- Organizing feels productive
- Procrastination disguised
- Perfectionism

**Fix:**

- System serves work, not vice versa
- "Is this helping me do work?"
- Simple > complex
- Good enough is good enough
</mistake>

<mistake name="All-or-Nothing Thinking">
**Symptom:** System abandoned after lapses, guilt about not following perfectly, restart cycles.

**Why it happens:**

- Perfectionism
- Seeing lapse as failure
- Not accepting imperfection

**Fix:**

- Lapses are normal
- Just start again from where you are
- Imperfect system > no system
- Weekly review catches up
</mistake>

<mistake name="Wrong Tool for the Task">
**Symptom:** Using complex tools for simple things, overthinking what should be easy.

**Why it happens:**

- Not understanding what each system does
- Over-engineering simple tasks
- Not choosing consciously

**Fix:**

- Quick capture → GTD skill
- Organization questions → PARA skill
- Cross-system sync → b4brain skill
- Match tool to need, keep it simple
</mistake>

<mistake name="PARA-GTD Desync">
**Symptom:** Projects in GTD without folders, folders without milestones, confusion about what's active.

**Why it happens:**

- Creating in one system but not the other
- No regular sync
- Different naming conventions

**Fix:**

- Use b4brain sync workflow regularly
- Match names exactly between systems
- Review sync status weekly
</mistake>

## Recovery Strategies

**When inbox is overwhelming:**

1. Don't try to process everything
2. Pick the 5 most important items
3. Process those through clarification
4. Archive or delete everything else
5. Commit to regular processing going forward

**When projects feel stuck:**

1. Review all projects
2. Ensure each project has ONE next action
3. Move stalled projects to Someday/Maybe
4. Focus on fewer projects

**When you've lost trust in the system:**

1. Start fresh with capture only
2. Process new items for one week
3. Don't worry about backlog yet
4. Rebuild trust through consistency
5. Then gradually tackle old items

**When PARA and GTD are out of sync:**

1. Run the b4brain sync workflow
2. Resolve mismatches one by one
3. Establish naming convention
4. Schedule regular sync checks

**When documentation is poor:**

1. Don't try to backfill everything
2. Start fresh - document new things well
3. Update old notes when you use them
4. Better documentation compounds over time
